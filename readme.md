The model in this paper consists of four parts which are autoencoder, attention mechanism , transformer encoder and finally classifier.
The autoencoder is used for the extraction of information for each omics data.The attention mechanism is used for the enhancement of the extracted information.The transformer encoder is used to extract the inter-group idiosyncratic information and to fuse the groups.Finally, MLP is applied to classify the patients based on the embedded information obtained from the above steps.
